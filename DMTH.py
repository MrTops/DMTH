    Version: 0.1

    Usage:
        - run DMTH.py
        - select a trick, use the up-down arrows to navigate, most of them will give a short description of what they do, if they do not it will warn you.
        - the trick will prompt you to enter in some text, after this hit enter and it will spit back your output
        - you will then be prompted to either return to the main menu or do that same trick again
